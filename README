Description:

This is a modified version of codeml included in the PAML4.8 package (Author: Ziheng Yang). This modifed version can calculate a new parameter, eta, which is the relative selection coefficient of non-synonymous transitions if considering that of non-synonymous transversions is 1. The following parameters need to be fixed in the codeml.ctl file (i.e. other models and choices not implemented):

################
seqtype = 1
clock = 0
model = 0
NSsites = 0
Mgene = 0
fix_alpha = 1
alpha = 0.
################
